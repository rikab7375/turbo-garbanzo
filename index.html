  <h1>Writing assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A well designed software that I have personally used and think is designed well is Google Classroom. I think that the software has a very user-friendly interface, and is well integrated with other Google software such as Google Docs, Slides, and Drive. For example, after completing an assignment such as an essay on Google Docs, it can easily be added to the classroom and submitted where the teacher can also grade the assignment and provide feedback. In my experience, Google Classroom simplifies keeping track of classes by having a centralized website where assignments, announcements from teachers, and grades can be easily accessed. In my opinion, the software was especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic where classes were fully online. Features such as a calendar which shows all upcoming assignments and tests were effective when it was difficult to keep track of due dates during online school. Overall, I think the software is designed well because of its simplicity, how easy it is to keep track of multiple classes, and how simple it is to submit assignments posted by teachers. Software design is important because it has a direct impact on the usability, functionality, and success of a software because it is the foundation for creating the code. Good software design can ensure that users will be able to utilize the system productively without unnecessary frustration or difficulties. Software design contributes to the software’s reliability and performance, ensuring that it functions smoothly under various conditions. Modularity, a major concept of software design, involves splitting the project into smaller pieces which makes it easier and simpler to achieve the requirements of the project. Finally, A good software design through creating modules has a direct impact on the maintainability of a software by making it easier to detect bugs and track errors.  </p>

  <p>The requirement gathering stage is the first step in software development and is the foundation for later stages of the software development cycle. During the requirements gathering stage, different stakeholders and developers work together to discuss the user’s needs, the problem that the software product should solve, and constraints. During the stage, requirements are gathered through methods such as interviews with clients to understand user needs, surveys to gather data from a large number of users quickly and brainstorming sessions to discuss and refine requirements. The information collected is then listed in a requirements document which acts as an official statement for the system’s requirements and as a checklist so all of the requirements can be uniquely identified and referenced efficiently. The requirements gathering stage is important because it ensures that developers have a clear understanding of what needs to be built, creating a foundation for later stages of the software development process. This is crucial because it reduces the likelihood of rework because of miscommunication later on. Overall, the requirements gathering stage ensures stakeholders are satisfied and the project aligns with user needs, minimizing the need for costly changes later in development. 

 

As a teacher, I want to create assignments with instructions, so that students can easily access their tasks and understand how to complete them. 

As a student, I want a calendar that shows upcoming due dates, so that I can remember when to submit my assignments.  

As a teacher, I want to grade and provide feedback on assignments, so that I can effectively communicate areas for improvement with students. 

As a parent, I want to receive deadlines for my child’s assignments, so that I can give them reminders and stay informed. 

 As a student, I want to communicate privately with my teachers, so that I can ask questions.  </p>

<p>The software product is Google Classroom. The software helps students and teachers
communicate and stay organized with their assignments. Some assumptions made about
this user is that he has a basic level of understanding of technology and how to navigate
software. It is assumed that he is comfortable using digital tools/grading systems and is
able to integrate technology into his teaching to enhance learning. </p>

  <h1>Writing assignment 4</h1>
<p>Communication is important in software design as it allows for effective collaboration and efficiency during the software development process. Effective communication ensures that all members of the project, such as developers and stakeholders, have a common understanding of the goals of the project and requirements, preventing delays and costly errors. This ensures that software developers can make informed decisions about the project, allowing developers to perform tasks in a timely manner and improving the overall efficiency in the development of the project. Three key elements of effective communication are clarity, active listening, and encouragement. Clarity ensures that what you are saying is communicated clearly and cannot be misunderstood. It ensures that members have a clear and precise understanding of tasks and requirements, preventing misinterpretations. Active listening involves listening attentively to whoever is speaking, responding and reflecting on what is being said and retaining the information. This further prevents misunderstandings and ensures everyone’s ideas and concerns are given proper consideration. Encouragement involves making team members feel supported and valued, prompting and making them more likely to share their ideas, voice concerns and contribute in discussions about the project.  This creates a positive atmosphere where members can contribute to the discussion without fear of judgement. A personal communication issue I have encountered was during a group assignment in English class where we had to create a presentation after analyzing a book. Each group member was supposed to create slides on specific themes, characters on symbolism. However, during the communication process, it was unclear on how we would split up the slides each of us would present during the presentation. As a result of this, a couple of us practiced a couple of the same slides, leaving other ones unattended and significantly increased our practice time. Given what I have learned in class, this issue could have been solved if we clearly communicated how the tasks would be split up. Overall, the example shows that effective communication minimizes delays and enhances efficiency when working with groups. </p>

<p>Simplicity means creating systems that are easy to understand and use. In software
design, it means getting rid of unnecessary complexity and focusing on essential features
so users can accomplish their goals with low effort. It enhances the usability of software,
reduces errors and makes it easier to interact with the system. Simplicity is important
since it has a direct impact on the user experience and efficiency of the software. For
example, when the design is simple, users spend less time figuring out how to use the
software and more time achieving their tasks that need to be completed. It also reduces
the likelihood of user errors as fewer options and unnecessary features mean that there
are fewer opportunities for mistakes. Furthermore, simplicity means that a broader
number of users can use the software, including those with limited technical knowledge
and can minimize training needs to use the system. Finally, simplicity ensures that the
system can be updated and maintained without unnecessary complexity. An example of
this is Google Classroom, which has a simple interface that includes essential features for
the user. Some features include buttons for teachers to post assignments, students to
submit assignments and calendars with reminders for deadlines. It does not contain any
unnecessary features that could confuse or overwhelm the user. Another example that
prioritizes simplicity is YouTube. The homepage sorts video topics into essential sections
such as “recommended” and “subscriptions.” Additionally, the like, subscribe and share
buttons are straightforward and clearly displayed making it easy to navigate for the user. In
both examples, simplicity improves the user experience by reducing confusion and
enhancing efficiency.</p>
