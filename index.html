  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A well designed software that I have personally used and think is designed well is Google Classroom. I think that the software has a very user-friendly interface, and is well integrated with other Google software such as Google Docs, Slides, and Drive. For example, after completing an assignment such as an essay on Google Docs, it can easily be added to the classroom and submitted where the teacher can also grade the assignment and provide feedback. In my experience, Google Classroom simplifies keeping track of classes by having a centralized website where assignments, announcements from teachers, and grades can be easily accessed. In my opinion, the software was especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic where classes were fully online. Features such as a calendar which shows all upcoming assignments and tests were effective when it was difficult to keep track of due dates during online school. Overall, I think the software is designed well because of its simplicity, how easy it is to keep track of multiple classes, and how simple it is to submit assignments posted by teachers. Software design is important because it has a direct impact on the usability, functionality, and success of a software because it is the foundation for creating the code. Good software design can ensure that users will be able to utilize the system productively without unnecessary frustration or difficulties. Software design contributes to the softwareâ€™s reliability and performance, ensuring that it functions smoothly under various conditions. Modularity, a major concept of software design, involves splitting the project into smaller pieces which makes it easier and simpler to achieve the requirements of the project. Finally, A good software design through creating modules has a direct impact on the maintainability of a software by making it easier to detect bugs and track errors.  </p>
