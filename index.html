  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A well designed software that I have personally used and think is designed well is Google Classroom. I think that the software has a very user-friendly interface, and is well integrated with other Google software such as Google Docs, Slides, and Drive. For example, after completing an assignment such as an essay on Google Docs, it can easily be added to the classroom and submitted where the teacher can also grade the assignment and provide feedback. In my experience, Google Classroom simplifies keeping track of classes by having a centralized website where assignments, announcements from teachers, and grades can be easily accessed. In my opinion, the software was especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic where classes were fully online. Features such as a calendar which shows all upcoming assignments and tests were effective when it was difficult to keep track of due dates during online school. Overall, I think the software is designed well because of its simplicity, how easy it is to keep track of multiple classes, and how simple it is to submit assignments posted by teachers. Software design is important because it has a direct impact on the usability, functionality, and success of a software because it is the foundation for creating the code. Good software design can ensure that users will be able to utilize the system productively without unnecessary frustration or difficulties. Software design contributes to the software’s reliability and performance, ensuring that it functions smoothly under various conditions. Modularity, a major concept of software design, involves splitting the project into smaller pieces which makes it easier and simpler to achieve the requirements of the project. Finally, A good software design through creating modules has a direct impact on the maintainability of a software by making it easier to detect bugs and track errors.  </p>

  <p>The requirement gathering stage is the first step in software development and is the foundation for later stages of the software development cycle. During the requirements gathering stage, different stakeholders and developers work together to discuss the user’s needs, the problem that the software product should solve, and constraints. During the stage, requirements are gathered through methods such as interviews with clients to understand user needs, surveys to gather data from a large number of users quickly and brainstorming sessions to discuss and refine requirements. The information collected is then listed in a requirements document which acts as an official statement for the system’s requirements and as a checklist so all of the requirements can be uniquely identified and referenced efficiently. The requirements gathering stage is important because it ensures that developers have a clear understanding of what needs to be built, creating a foundation for later stages of the software development process. This is crucial because it reduces the likelihood of rework because of miscommunication later on. Overall, the requirements gathering stage ensures stakeholders are satisfied and the project aligns with user needs, minimizing the need for costly changes later in development. 

 

As a teacher, I want to create assignments with instructions, so that students can easily access their tasks and understand how to complete them. 

As a student, I want a calendar that shows upcoming due dates, so that I can remember when to submit my assignments.  

As a teacher, I want to grade and provide feedback on assignments, so that I can effectively communicate areas for improvement with students. 

As a parent, I want to receive deadlines for my child’s assignments, so that I can give them reminders and stay informed. 

 As a student, I want to communicate privately with my teachers, so that I can ask questions.  </p>
